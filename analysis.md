Based on the data you've provided, I can help you synthesize the findings and address your research questions. Here's a summary of the analysis:

### 1. How do riders' physiological responses (stress) vary between traditional bicycles and electric cargo bikes at different speeds and cargo loads?

**Findings from Stress Analysis (GSR Data):**
- **Mean GSR Levels**:
    - For **Normal Bike**:
        - With no load: Mean GSR = 0.777
        - With load: Mean GSR = 0.795
    - For **Cargo Bike**:
        - With no load: Mean GSR = 0.781
        - With load: Mean GSR = 0.773

**Interpretation**:
- The GSR levels (indicating stress) are slightly higher for the normal bike with a load compared to no load, suggesting increased stress when carrying a load on a traditional bike.
- For the cargo bike, the GSR levels are slightly lower with a load than without, indicating potentially less stress when carrying a load compared to the traditional bike.
- The electric cargo bike appears to mitigate stress associated with carrying loads compared to the normal bike.

### 2. How does gaze behavior differ between riders of traditional bicycles and electric cargo bikes in various controlled and uncontrolled conditions?

**Findings from Gaze Analysis:**
- **Average Norm Pos X and Pos Y**:
    - **Normal Bike**:
        - Without load: Avg Norm Pos X = 0.459, Pos Y = 0.541
        - With load: Avg Norm Pos X = 0.353, Pos Y = 0.580
    - **Cargo Bike**:
        - Without load: Avg Norm Pos X = 0.456, Pos Y = 0.551
        - With load: Avg Norm Pos X = 0.470, Pos Y = 0.554

**Interpretation**:
- Gaze positions indicate that with a load, riders on the normal bike tend to lower their gaze (Pos Y increases), possibly due to increased caution or effort.
- On the cargo bike, gaze positions are relatively stable, even with a load, suggesting that riders feel more comfortable or secure.
- The electric cargo bike may offer a more relaxed riding experience, allowing for more consistent gaze behavior.

### Additional Findings from Correlation and IMU Data:
- **Correlation Analysis**:
    - There are correlations between eye positions, GSR, and IMU data, which suggest interactions between physiological responses and motion during cycling.
    - These correlations can highlight how stress and motion impact gaze behavior differently for the two types of bikes.

- **IMU Data**:
    - The IMU data shows differences in acceleration (m/sÂ²) across different conditions, which can reflect the physical effort required to operate each bike type under various loads.

### Conclusion:
- **Stress Response**: The traditional bike shows higher stress levels under load, while the electric cargo bike demonstrates better stress management, potentially due to the electric assistance.
- **Gaze Behavior**: Riders on the electric cargo bike maintain more stable gaze patterns, indicating a potentially safer and more comfortable riding experience under varying conditions.

These insights support the notion that electric cargo bikes can reduce physical and psychological strain, especially under load, compared to traditional bikes.
